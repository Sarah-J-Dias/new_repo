# These text files are from a Project Management Case Challenge that I participated in recently
The first file is a stakeholder register, which outlines the names, roles, and interests of each of the stakeholders for given project. 
The second file is the change request form, which is filled out when there was an expected obstacle, and explains the change and proposed action for the project.
